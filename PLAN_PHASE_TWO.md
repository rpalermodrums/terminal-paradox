# Terminal Paradox - Phase Two Development Plan

## Vision
Transform Terminal Paradox from a proof-of-concept into a mind-bending meta-game that blurs the line between game and terminal, fiction and system reality.

## Core Enhancements

### 1. 🧩 Advanced Puzzle System
**Priority: HIGH**

#### Implemented Puzzle Types
- **Regex Escape Sequences**: Match complex patterns to "grep" your way through corrupted memory
- **Binary Arithmetic**: Solve permission puzzles using actual chmod octal calculations
- **Process Tree Puzzles**: Kill processes in correct order to avoid fork bombs
- **Pipe Chain Challenges**: Connect commands with pipes to create data flows
- **Memory Allocation**: Manage heap/stack to prevent overflows
- **Signal Handling**: Send correct signals to processes (SIGTERM, SIGKILL, etc.)

#### Puzzle Engine Features
```typescript
interface Puzzle {
  validate(input: string): boolean;
  getHints(attempts: number): string[];
  onSolve(): void;
  corruptionModifier: number;
}
```

### 2. 🌀 Dynamic Corruption System
**Priority: HIGH**

#### Corruption Effects
- **Text Scrambling**: Progressive character replacement
- **Command Interception**: Commands randomly execute different actions
- **Memory Fragmentation**: Inventory items randomly swap positions
- **Time Dilation**: Game speed changes based on corruption
- **False Rooms**: Hallucination rooms that don't really exist
- **Input Lag**: Delayed command execution at high corruption
- **Echo Loops**: Commands repeat themselves

#### Corruption Sources
- Failed puzzle attempts
- Using wrong commands
- Staying in corrupted rooms too long
- Picking up "infected" items
- Random system events

### 3. 🔮 Meta-Gaming Elements
**Priority: HIGH**

#### Self-Aware Features
- **Source Code Access**: Find and modify the game's own .ts files as puzzles
- **Save File Manipulation**: Edit your save file to unlock secrets
- **Terminal Detection**: Game behaves differently in different terminals
- **File System Integration**: Create actual files in temp directory as part of puzzles
- **Process Monitoring**: Game detects what else is running on system
- **Git Integration**: Some puzzles require git commands on the game's repo

#### Breaking the Fourth Wall
```typescript
// Example: Player must edit this constant in the source to proceed
export const LOCKED_DOOR_PASSWORD = "CHANGE_ME_IN_SOURCE";
```

### 4. 📖 Narrative Depth
**Priority: MEDIUM**

#### Story Elements
- **System Logs**: Discover previous victims' attempts to escape
- **Kernel Panic Notes**: Hidden lore about how the paradox started
- **Process Memories**: Each killed process reveals story fragments
- **Root's Diary**: Final boss backstory
- **Corrupted Emails**: SMTP messages revealing the truth

#### Multiple Endings
1. **True Escape**: Complete puzzle mastery
2. **System Integration**: Become one with the terminal
3. **Recursive Loop**: Restart as a different user
4. **Kernel Override**: Destroy the system from within
5. **Secret Ending**: Achieve through meta-puzzle solving

### 5. 🎮 Advanced Mechanics
**Priority: MEDIUM**

#### Command Combinations
```typescript
// Example combinations
"ls | grep" -> "deep_search"  // Find hidden files
"sudo + kill" -> "force_kill"  // Destroy unkillable processes
"cat | echo" -> "duplicate"    // Clone items
"chmod + sudo" -> "god_mode"   // Temporary invincibility
```

#### Terminal Physics
- **Item Weight**: Commands have memory cost
- **Gravity**: Items fall through directory tree
- **Collision**: Can't have duplicate commands in same room
- **Entropy**: Unused items decay over time

### 6. 🌐 Connected Features
**Priority: LOW**

#### Asynchronous Multiplayer
- **Ghost Messages**: Leave hints for other players
- **Shared Corruption**: Global corruption level affects all players
- **Time Capsules**: Items left by players who escaped
- **Leaderboard**: Speedrun times, lowest corruption escape

#### Cloud Integration
- **Cross-Device Saves**: Continue on different machines
- **Achievement Sync**: Track progress across sessions
- **Daily Challenges**: New procedural puzzles each day

### 7. 🎨 Visual & Audio Enhancement
**Priority: MEDIUM**

#### Visual Effects
- **Matrix Rain**: During high corruption
- **Glitch Transitions**: Room changes with visual artifacts
- **ASCII Animations**: Animated sprites for key moments
- **Parallax Scrolling**: Multi-layer terminal effects
- **CRT Shader Effects**: Scanlines, chromatic aberration

#### Audio System
```typescript
interface TerminalAudio {
  beep(frequency: number, duration: number): void;
  playSequence(notes: Note[]): void;
  generateWhiteNoise(corruption: number): void;
}
```

### 8. 🔧 Technical Improvements
**Priority: HIGH**

#### Performance
- **Lazy Room Loading**: Load rooms on demand
- **State Compression**: Optimize save file size
- **Render Optimization**: Use React.memo and useMemo
- **Command Caching**: Cache parsed commands
